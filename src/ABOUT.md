A dashboard of historical governance of [Compound Finance](compound.finance) with an emphasis on highlighting the rational behind voter's decisions (hence the Twitter embeds). My personal thesis is that [proxy governance is inevitable](https://medium.com/@lsquaredleland/centralized-governance-is-inevitable-3017edeed65e), therefore it is important to highlight the relationships between voters and delegators and keep the former party accountable. Compound's governance has a native delegation feature which is especially apt for this and will be explored in greater detail over time (look at attached design files for inspiration).

AND YES - `Time` is faked
ALSO it seems that over time there are less tweets from individual votes (or more realistically I can't find them)
